      Refinance with Cash Out from Your Home
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      If you’re in need of money, whether it’s for home renovations, college
      tuition, or paying off debt, refinancing your home to capitalize on its
      equity can be a way to get extra cash. Refinancing in order to get cash
      from your home is known as ”cash out refinance.” The process of getting
      money from your home is actually surprisingly simple, and you have two
      options. You can get a line of credit (Home Equity Line of Credit) or you
      can refinance your home loan and get additional money at closing (also
      known as a cash mortgage). To determine which method of getting cash is
      best, and which is a better fit for your unique financial situation,
      contact one of our Home Loan Experts for a free instant rate quote. We can
      also help you get the best cash out refinance rates.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-primary">What is Home Refinancing?</h2>
    <p class="">
      Home refinancing is obtaining a second loan, or mortgage, in order to pay
      off your original one. The trick to refinancing is to make sure that the
      second loan has a far lower interest rate, essentially lowering the costs
      of your first mortgage.
    </p>

    <ng-container *ngIf="visible">
      <div>
        <p class="">
          The monetary difference between the first and second mortgages is the
          equivalent of cash back. You can save hundreds of dollars per month by
          refinancing your home at low refinance cash out rates and obtaining a
          second mortgage. If you’re in need of money or have bills to pay, this
          can be a great way to get cash from your home. Your cash mortgage can
          be used to pay for college tuition, to advance your career with a new
          degree, to buy a car, to pay off debt, or even to go on that vacation
          you’ve always dreamt about.

          Get an Immediate Payment from Your Home Loan
        </h2>
        <p class="">
          There are a host of reasons why property holders refinance to get
          money from their homes. Life is loaded with surprises and in the event
          you ever confront a situation or event that you didn’t anticipate—for
          example, unemployment, a medical emergency, or something similar—your
          home’s value can help you make money from your house to pay these
          expenses. Another of the many reasons you might consider refinancing
          is to get cash from your home to pay for home renovations. These
          changes can vastly increase the value of your home and make it more
          alluring to potential buyers. Perhaps, however, you simply wish to get
          some extra money to pay for a much-needed vacation, your ideal car, or
          another dream purchase you’ve been thinking about for a while. With
          superb customer support from EZ Online Mortgage, you can easily find
          the ideal mortgage to meet your needs.

                Not necessarily. Pre-approval is a thorough investigation of
                your application for a mortgage loan. The result (if successful)
                will be a letter that indicates you are qualified for a mortgage
                at the amount you have requested. That doesn't always mean you
                will get final approval for the mortgage. Lots of other factors
                impact the mortgage approval process—the value of the home is
                key, as well as potential changes to your credit or employment
                status between pre-approval and final determination.

                Great question. One smart move is to check your credit reports
                before you start the application. If there is any incorrect
                information, you can begin the process of getting it resolved.
                Also, don’t open or close any credit accounts if you can avoid
                it—those actions can cause a temporary decrease in your score.
                The other thing that helps is to give us as much information as
                possible—fill out everything completely.

                A point on a loan is a price the borrower pays to lower the
                interest rate. A lender may offer a loan with a specific
                interest rate and a one-point fee. The "point" equals one
                percent of the loan total, paid in advance. It might make sense
                to pay the point to bring down the interest rate, especially if
                you plan to remain in the home over a long period.

                will charge you a fee if you pay the loan off early or

                A rate lock promises that the lender can complete the processing
                of your loan with the interest rate and points available on a
                particular day. The "lock" is valid for a period of time—usually
                30 or 60 days. Sometimes you can lock in the rate just by asking
                while you navigate through the approval process. Depending on
                the loan program, you might have to pay a fee to guarantee the
                rate.
