    <p class="">
      If you currently have an adjustable rate mortgage, you might be concerned
      about your interest rate going up. Though adjustable rate and other
      mortgages seem very appealing at first, because the interest rates are
      low, but what happens at the end of the fixed-rate period? The answer?
      Your mortgage payment more than likely goes up. The good news is that
      there are strategies to avoid this.

      Avoid A Rising Interest Rate with Refinancing
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      Refinancing your mortgage can have many benefits, not least among them is
      to keep your payment from rising. Refinancing, while not for everyone, has
      many pluses. With refinancing, keep your interest rate from rising, lower
      your monthly mortgage payments, and save hundreds, if not thousands, of
      dollars monthly. With refinancing, you can consolidate your debts, pay for
      higher education, pay off your credit cards, and secure low and stable
      interest rate for your home.

                Not necessarily. Pre-approval is a thorough investigation of
                your application for a mortgage loan. The result (if successful)
                will be a letter that indicates you are qualified for a mortgage
                at the amount you have requested. That doesn't always mean you
                will get final approval for the mortgage. Lots of other factors
                impact the mortgage approval process—the value of the home is
                key, as well as potential changes to your credit or employment
                status between pre-approval and final determination.

                Great question. One smart move is to check your credit reports
                before you start the application. If there is any incorrect
                information, you can begin the process of getting it resolved.
                Also, don’t open or close any credit accounts if you can avoid
                it—those actions can cause a temporary decrease in your score.
                The other thing that helps is to give us as much information as
                possible—fill out everything completely.

                A point on a loan is a price the borrower pays to lower the
                interest rate. A lender may offer a loan with a specific
                interest rate and a one-point fee. The "point" equals one
                percent of the loan total, paid in advance. It might make sense
                to pay the point to bring down the interest rate, especially if
                you plan to remain in the home over a long period.

                lender. Reputation is essential, and the costs of applying and
                completing the mortgage process. Also, look out for questionable

                will charge you a fee if you pay the loan off early or

                A rate lock promises that the lender can complete the processing
                of your loan with the interest rate and points available on a
                particular day. The "lock" is valid for a period of time—usually
                30 or 60 days. Sometimes you can lock in the rate just by asking
                while you navigate through the approval process. Depending on
                the loan program, you might have to pay a fee to guarantee the
                rate.
