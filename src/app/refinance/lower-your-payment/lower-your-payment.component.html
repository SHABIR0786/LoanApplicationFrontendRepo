          Extend Your Loan Term for Lower Mortgage Payments in California
        </h2>
        <p class="">
          If your current interest rate is comparable to that of the market, a
          rate refinance may not make sense. The good news is that you may still
          be able to lower your mortgage payments. For example, you may be able
          to refinance at the same rate that you have now, but extend the term
          of your loan. This gives you more time to pay off the balance, which
          results in lower mortgage payments. Lock in at an attractive fixed
          rate for the term of your choice and spend the extra cash you’ll save
          on other lifestyle needs. Take that vacation you’ve always wanted or
          purchase your dream car. The sky’s the limit! All it takes is a simple

          Drop PMI to Lower Your Mortgage Payment
        </h2>
        <p class="">
          Refinancing your mortgage can do more than just get you a better rate
          or change your loan terms. If you have enough equity in your home, you
          could be saving money on lower mortgage payments by getting rid of
          private mortgage insurance (PMI). If you put less than 20% down on
          your home when you purchased it, chances are your lender is assessing
          an added fee to your monthly payment to cover PMI. By refinancing and
          leveraging the increased value of your home, your payments could be
          significantly lower. Not sure if you’re paying PMI or have other
          questions about how to lower your mortgage payments? That’s what we’re
          here for! Our experienced mortgage consultants can conduct an in-depth

                Not necessarily. Pre-approval is a thorough investigation of
                your application for a mortgage loan. The result (if successful)
                will be a letter that indicates you are qualified for a mortgage
                at the amount you have requested. That doesn't always mean you
                will get final approval for the mortgage. Lots of other factors
                impact the mortgage approval process—the value of the home is
                key, as well as potential changes to your credit or employment

                Great question. One smart move is to check your credit reports
                before you start the application. If there is any incorrect
                information, you can begin the process of getting it resolved.
                Also, don’t open or close any credit accounts if you can avoid
                it—those actions can cause a temporary decrease in your score.
                The other thing that helps is to give us as much information as
                possible—fill out everything completely.

                A point on a loan is a price the borrower pays to lower the
                interest rate. A lender may offer a loan with a specific
                interest rate and a one-point fee. The "point" equals one
                percent of the loan total, paid in advance. It might make sense
                to pay the point to bring down the interest rate, especially if
                you plan to remain in the home over a long period.

                No. There are numerous factors to evaluate when choosing your
                lender. Reputation is essential, and the costs of applying and
                completing the mortgage process. Also, look out for questionable
                practices like pre-payment penalties, which means the lender
                will charge you a fee if you pay the loan off early or
                refinance.

                A rate lock promises that the lender can complete the processing
                of your loan with the interest rate and points available on a
                particular day. The "lock" is valid for a period of time—usually
                30 or 60 days. Sometimes you can lock in the rate just by asking
                while you navigate through the approval process. Depending on
                the loan program, you might have to pay a fee to guarantee the
                rate.
