    <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-primary">Consolidate Your Debt</h2>
    <p class="">
      Being in debt is not fun—it’s stressful,draining, and can even feel
      dehumanizing. Whether you have student loans to pay off, credit card debt,
      or other high-interest debt, consolidating your debt and taking control of
      your financial situation isn’t as hard as you might think. In fact, you
      may already be sitting on the cash you needs to consolidate your debt.
      That’s right, if you’re a homeowner, your house could be the key to
      consolidate your debt and other loans —you just need someone to help you
      turn that asset into cash.
    </p>
    <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-primary">
      Consolidate Your Debt With Refinancing
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      By refinancing your home, you can get extra cash with which to consolidate
      your debt. What is refinancing? When you refinance, you essentially take
      out a second mortgage (loan)—at a lower interest rate—on your house. This
      second mortgage allows you pay less overall per month, meaning extra cash
      in your pocket. Plus, unlike credit cards and unsecured loans from loan
      consolidation companies, the interest on this second mortgage is usually
      tax-deductible.

                Not necessarily. Pre-approval is a thorough investigation of
                your application for a mortgage loan. The result (if successful)
                will be a letter that indicates you are qualified for a mortgage
                at the amount you have requested. That doesn't always mean you
                will get final approval for the mortgage. Lots of other factors
                impact the mortgage approval process—the value of the home is
                key, as well as potential changes to your credit or employment
                status between pre-approval and final determination.

                Great question. One smart move is to check your credit reports
                before you start the application. If there is any incorrect
                information, you can begin the process of getting it resolved.
                Also, don’t open or close any credit accounts if you can avoid
                it—those actions can cause a temporary decrease in your score.
                The other thing that helps is to give us as much information as
                possible—fill out everything completely.

                A point on a loan is a price the borrower pays to lower the
                interest rate. A lender may offer a loan with a specific
                interest rate and a one-point fee. The "point" equals one
                percent of the loan total, paid in advance. It might make sense
                to pay the point to bring down the interest rate, especially if
                you plan to remain in the home over a long period.

                will charge you a fee if you pay the loan off early or

                A rate lock promises that the lender can complete the processing
                of your loan with the interest rate and points available on a
                particular day. The "lock" is valid for a period of time—usually
                30 or 60 days. Sometimes you can lock in the rate just by asking
                while you navigate through the approval process. Depending on
                the loan program, you might have to pay a fee to guarantee the
                rate.
