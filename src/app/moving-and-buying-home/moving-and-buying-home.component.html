      Need a Moving Mortgage Provider?
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      There comes a time in most people’s lives where they find themselves
      facing the exciting and stressful process of selling the house, getting a
      mortgage and moving into their next house. If you’re moving to your next
      house with mortgage needs – whether it’s your first or third home – EZ
      Online Mortgage is ready to guide you through the mortgage process.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">
      Should You Sell Before Buying a New Home?
    </h2>
    <p class="">
      Most home buyers, especially first-time buyers who might have inherited
      the home they’re currently living in, prefer to sell their current home
      before purchasing a new one. This “out with the old, in with the new”
      mantra actually makes a lot of practical sense: sitting on a home is a lot
      like sitting on unused cash—cash that could be used towards the purchase
      of a new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a home is also an asset, and assets can appreciate and depreciate,
      and, if one is clever about it, be used to turn a profit. If you plan to
      sell your house, you would ideally like to sell for the highest price
      possible, giving you the money necessary for moving and buying a home.
    </p>
    <ng-container *ngIf="visible">
      <div>
        <p>
          Sometimes, however, the market is not conducive to selling. If you are
          attempting to sell your house in a buyer’s market, expect to get
          shortchanged, because the buyer is king. If you’re selling in a
          seller’s market, however, and house values are rising, you can expect
          to walk away with a pleasant, tidy sum. If the current market is a
          bust, don’t feel pressured to sell. In fact, it’s not necessary to
          sell your current home before buying a second home. In fact with a
          moving home mortgage, you don’t have to have any hesitations about
          moving into a new home while keeping your old one. Then, when market
          forces have turned in your favor, you can sell your previous home at a
          much better price.

                Not necessarily. Pre-approval is a thorough investigation of
                your application for a mortgage loan. The result (if successful)
                will be a letter that indicates you are qualified for a mortgage
                at the amount you have requested. That doesn't always mean you
                will get final approval for the mortgage. Lots of other factors
                impact the mortgage approval process—the value of the home is
                key, as well as potential changes to your credit or employment
                status between pre-approval and final determination.

                Great question. One smart move is to check your credit reports
                before you start the application. If there is any incorrect
                information, you can begin the process of getting it resolved.
                Also, don’t open or close any credit accounts if you can avoid
                it—those actions can cause a temporary decrease in your score.
                The other thing that helps is to give us as much information as
                possible—fill out everything completely.

                A point on a loan is a price the borrower pays to lower the
                interest rate. A lender may offer a loan with a specific
                interest rate and a one-point fee. The "point" equals one
                percent of the loan total, paid in advance. It might make sense
                to pay the point to bring down the interest rate, especially if

                No. There are numerous factors to evaluate when choosing your
                lender. Reputation is essential, and the costs of applying and
                completing the mortgage process. Also, look out for questionable

                A rate lock promises that the lender can complete the processing
                of your loan with the interest rate and points available on a
                particular day. The "lock" is valid for a period of time—usually
                30 or 60 days. Sometimes you can lock in the rate just by asking
                while you navigate through the approval process. Depending on
                the loan program, you might have to pay a fee to guarantee the
                rate.
