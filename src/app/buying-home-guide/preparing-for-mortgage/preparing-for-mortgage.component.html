                A free mortgage consultation will include a review of your
                credit to pinpoint areas in which you could improve. We
                recommend starting with one before you begin visiting open
                houses and meeting with realtors. You’ll want to know if you
                qualify for a mortgage and your budget before you find your
                dream home.

              </h6>
              <p class="text-muted">
                If you are a first-time home buyer or haven’t purchased a home
                in a long time, meeting with a mortgage consultant a year before
                you plan on buying a home is the best way to prepare your
                finances for the mortgage preapproval process.

              <p class="text-muted">
                You may need to keep your credit card balances lower, open a
                small installment loan, or pay off debt to be approved for the
                home purchase price you desire. If you’re thinking of buying a
                new car within the year, you may need to wait until you close on
                your home to ensure there is room in your debt-to-income ratio.
                A free mortgage consultation will put you in the best financial
                place to buy a house.

                When you are three to six months out from starting your house
                hunt with an agent, it’s time to gather the required
                documentation and sit down with your mortgage broker again to
                finalize your preapproval. In general, a mortgage lender will
                want to review the following most recent information:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>• Two years of your tax documentation</li>

              <p class="text-muted">
                At this time, you will also need to let the mortgage consultant
                know the course of your down payment funds, especially if gift
                funds are involved or if you are selling stocks or bonds. You’ll
                need a documented paper trail of these transactions.

                    Don’t have a lot of credit history, or worried it’s not good
                    enough? FHA loans have more lenient credit and income
                    requirements, and your down payment can be as low as 3.5%.

                    Think you’ll only be in a starter home for a few years? An
                    adjustable rate mortgage gives you a low fixed interest rate –
                    which means lower monthly payments – for the first few years
                    of your mortgage.
