                  and insurance) won’t change, and you can buy a home with as

                  Want payment and interest rate stability? With a 30-Year
                  Fixed, your interest rate and monthly payments (before taxes
                  and insurance) won’t change, and you can buy a home with as
                  little as 3% down.

                  Don’t have a lot of credit history, or worried it’s not good
                  enough? FHA loans have more lenient credit and income
                  requirements, and your down payment can be as low as 3.5%.

                  Think you’ll only be in a starter home for a few years? An
                  adjustable rate mortgage gives you a low fixed interest rate –
                  which means lower monthly payments – for the first few years
                  of your mortgage.
