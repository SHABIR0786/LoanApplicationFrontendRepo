                  and insurance) won’t change, and you can buy a home with as

                How to Find the Right Real Estate Agent
              </h3>
              <p class="text-muted">
                If you’re buying a home, then there is no cost to work with a
                real estate agent. Their commission of 3% for the buyer’s agent
                and 3% for the seller’s agent comes directly from the seller.
                The first place to start your agent hunt is by asking for
                recommendations from friends and family. If someone you know and
                trust had a great experience with their real estate agent,
                chances are good that you will too.
              </p>
              <p class="text-muted">
                Once you’ve received a few names, take time to interview the
                agents to see who will best fit your home buying experience.
                Below are a few, key questions to ask during the agent interview
                process.

                    best agents close on several homes a month and are
                    successful for a reason.

                    Asking for the three most recent home sales ensures the
