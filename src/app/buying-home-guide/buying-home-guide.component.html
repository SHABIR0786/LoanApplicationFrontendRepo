                Am I Ready to Buy a Home?
              </h3>
              <p class="text-muted">
                Determining whether you are ready to purchase your first home is
                an important undertaking, and there are several factors to
                consider when deciding if you’re ready:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  • Are you going to be in the house for at least five years?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    Make sure your job and family life are in a settled state.
                    If you move prior to year five of occupancy, it may not be
                    the best financial decision considering Realtor commissions,
                    attorney’s fees, and taxes you would be responsible for
                    paying.
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  • Are you ready to tackle day-to-day home maintenance
                  responsibilities?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    Unlike renting, when you own your own home, you are
                    responsible for handling all repairs and maintenance. Make
                    sure there is extra room in your budget and savings for
                    unexpected expenses like a new HVAC, new appliances, and
                    roof repairs.
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  • Have you saved enough money for a down payment?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    The down payment is usually what stands between future
                    homeowners and their dream of homeownership. Banks and
                    lending institutions are looking for you to have some skin
                    in the game before they loan you a large sum of money. At
                    least 3% down is generally required to be approved for a
                    mortgage and more than that is ideal. Depending on your
                    vocation, income, and where you live, grants may also be an
                    option to subsidize or completely cover this expense. Gifts
                    from family members are also a common source of a down
                    payment—just make sure to talk to your mortgage consultant
                    about any gifts you may be receiving.
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  • Do you have money set aside separate of the down payment
                  funds for closing costs and financial emergencies?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    Once the down payment and closing costs are accounted for,
                    it is also imperative that you have separate emergency
                    fund—we usually recommend between three months and six
                    months of living expenses. If you are short on closing
                    costs, ask your real estate agent about negotiating for the
                    seller to pay them.
                  </span>
                </li>

                Should I Buy or Keep Renting?
              </h6>
              <p class="text-muted">
                Deciding when it’s the right time to buy a home is one of the
                most important decisions you’ll ever make. There are so many
                factors to consider including timing and the state of your
                finances. Carefully consider the factors below before deciding
                to stop renting and leaping into homeownership:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  • Are you planning on staying in the same location for at
                  least the next five years?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    There are expenses involved in selling a home (taxes,
                    realtor fees, closing costs, etc.). You could potentially
                    lose money if you move too soon. Make sure you are happy and
                    settled in your job and will not be relocating anytime soon.
                    Also, if you have school-aged children or children who will
                    become school-age within five years, make sure you like the
                    schools where you plan on buying.
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  • Do you have room in your budget to cover extra expenses
                  associated with homeownership?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    When you buy a house, you will be responsible for home
                    maintenance, repairs, and updates. So, you need to make sure
                    extra expenses fit into your budget.
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  • Have you put aside money for a down payment and closing
                  costs?
                  <span class="text-muted">
                    The down payment is the main barrier between most people and
                    their dream of owning a home. In general, you need to have
                    at least 3 to 3.5 percent of the total home purchase price
                    for a home loan approval. However, 5 to 10 percent is ideal.
                    Twenty percent down is required to avoid mortgage premium
                    insurance. Keep in mind, many first-time homebuyers utilize
                    a gift from a family member to help with the down payment.
                    Talk with your mortgage consultant if you anticipate a gift
                    from a family member. Also, ask your loan officer if there
                    are any grant programs in your area to help cover your down
                    payment. Closing costs generally range from 3-5% of the
                    house’s purchase price. The seller often will pay for
                    closing costs, but that’s not always the case. So, talk to
                    your realtor if you need additional help with closing funds.

                    Want payment and interest rate stability? With a 30-Year
                    Fixed, your interest rate and monthly payments (before taxes
                    and insurance) won’t change, and you can buy a home with as

                    Don’t have a lot of credit history, or worried it’s not good
                    enough? FHA loans have more lenient credit and income

                    which means lower monthly payments – for the first few years
