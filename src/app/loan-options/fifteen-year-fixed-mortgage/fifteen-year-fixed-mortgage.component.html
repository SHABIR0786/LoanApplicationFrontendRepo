            A 15 year loan is the right choice if you want to pay off the loan,
            and you can afford a higher payment. Take advantage of low interest
            rates to make a big difference in your principal.

                A 15-year fixed rate mortgage loan might be the best choice for
                you if you prefer the security of a stable interest rate, but
                you would like to make progress toward paying off your loan more
                quickly than with a 30-year mortgage.
              </p>

                  <p class="text-muted">
                    The monthly payments will be higher than the payments for
                    the same loan amount on a 30-year schedule, but the total
                    you pay to interest will be much less over the life of the
                    loan. 15-year fixed rate loans are conventional mortgages,
                    just like 30-year loans, so the loan amount limits are the
                    same. Conventional loans have these limits because the
                    lender you get the loan from usually sells it to a GSE
                    (government sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac or Fannie
                    Mae) which in turn sells it to investors. This lets the bank
                    or other lender offer mortgages to more borrowers.

                What are the advantages of <br />a 15 year fixed loan?
              </h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                The biggest advantage for you is paying less interest while you
                pay the loan. By limiting your loan term to 15 years, <br />you
                dramatically reduce the amount of interest you pay.

                  <p class="text-muted">
                    The 15-year loan will almost always have a slightly lower
                    interest rate than a 30-year loan, and with the shorter
                    term, you would pay less than half the amount of interest
                    over the course of the loan. You will also increase your
                    equity in the home faster, because you are paying more
                    toward the principal balance each month. This is helpful in
                    case you need to refinance.

                How do I qualify for <br />A 15-Year Fixed Loan?
              </h5>
              <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                For the conventional loan, whether 15-year or 30-year fixed
                rate, the key factors in qualifying are your credit score and
                debt-to-income ratio. There are two versions of the ratio that
                lenders may use: front-end and back-end.
              </p>

                <div>
                  <p class="text-muted">
                    Either type compares the percentage of your monthly income
                    that is committed. A front-end ratio considers just your
                    housing costs, while the back-end ratio (more common in
                    evaluating you for a mortgage approval) includes other debt
                    payments as well, and usually needs to be under 43 %.

                How Does Mortgage Insurance Work
              </h3>

              <ul class="text-muted arrow-list">
                <li>
                  Mortgage insurance is required on almost every new loan with a
                  down payment of less than twenty percent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mortgage insurance protects the lender from losses, and this
                  allows them to offer loans they might not otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most conventional loans qualify for private mortgage
                  insurance, paid monthly along with the principal and interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In some cases with a conventional loan, you can request to
                  have the mortgage insurance dropped when your equity in the
                  loan reaches twenty percent, but in other cases you may need
                  to refinance the loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FHA loans have mortgage insurance that you pay to the Federal
                  Housing Administration. For these loans there is a fee at the
                  loan closing plus a monthly charge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FHA loans must maintain the mortgage insurance, so to stop
                  paying the MI, you need to refinance into a conventional loan
                  type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  VA (Veteran’s Administration) loans don’t need mortgage
                  insurance, because the VA guarantees the loan for you. But
                  there is an upfront funding fee that varies depending on
                  several factors, including:
