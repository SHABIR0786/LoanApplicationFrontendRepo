              <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                The 30 year fixed rate loan is always among the most popular
                choices for borrowers. If you need lower payments, and the
                security of an interest rate that won’t change, the 30-year
                fixed rate may be the right loan for you.

                    If you are making a down payment of 20% or more, you won’t
                    need private mortgage insurance. The federal government
                    doesn’t guarantee conventional loans (30-year loans are one
                    of several types of loan that fall into the conventional
                    loan category), but it does set the limits for how much a
                    conforming loan can be. The Federal Housing Finance Agency
                    sets a baseline limit. In 2021 that limit is $548,250. Some
                    parts of the country have higher limits, since housing
                    prices are higher. A maximum conforming loan amount in these
                    areas can reach $822,375.

                A 30-year fixed rate mortgage may offer the best way for a
                borrower to “buy more house.” Because the length of the loan is
                longer, the payments are lower than with some other loan types.

              <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                To get approved for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, you need a
                good credit score, proof of income, and money saved for a down
                paymen0t. You should also have a debt-to-income ratio of 50% or
                less. Debt-to-income ratio is the amount of your monthly income
                that is going to debts like credit cards, car loans, and student
                loans.

                <li>
                  Choose a 30-year fixed rate mortgage if you want to spread the

                How Does Mortgage Insurance Work
              </h3>
              <p class="text-muted">
                You’ll have to pay primary mortgage insurance (PMI) if your down
                payment is less than 20%.
              </p>
              <ul class="text-muted arrow-list">
                <li>
                  Mortgage insurance is required on almost every new loan with a
                  down payment of less than twenty percent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mortgage insurance protects the lender from losses, and this
                  allows them to offer loans they might not otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most conventional loans qualify for private mortgage
                  insurance, paid monthly along with the principal and interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In some cases with a conventional loan, you can request to
                  have the mortgage insurance dropped when your equity in the
                  loan reaches twenty percent, but in other cases you may need
                  to refinance the loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FHA loans have mortgage insurance that you pay to the Federal
                  Housing Administration. For these loans there is a fee at the
                  loan closing plus a monthly charge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FHA loans must maintain the mortgage insurance, so to stop
                  paying the MI, you need to refinance into a conventional loan
                  type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  VA (Veteran’s Administration) loans don’t need mortgage
                  insurance, because the VA guarantees the loan for you. But
                  there is an upfront funding fee that varies depending on
                  several factors, including:
