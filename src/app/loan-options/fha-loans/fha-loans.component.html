                    FHA loans are guaranteed by the Department of Housing and
                    Urban Development, and the FHA approves the lenders that
                    offer these loans. Almost 50 million borrowers have received
                    FHA-insured loans since the program started in 1934. FHA
                    loans are sometimes called first-time home buyers because of
                    the easygoing credit standards and low down payments.

              <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                The low down payment and lenient credit score requirements are
                among the attractive aspects of an FHA loan from the buyer’s
                perspective. For the lender, the federal guarantee makes the
                loans secure.

                    The borrowers must be buying the home as a primary
                    residence, not investment property, which makes the loan a
                    higher prospect for repayment. FHA loans also allow
                    borrowers to use gifted funds for both down payments and
                    closing costs in many cases, making these loans even more
                    accessible. The FHA program offers fixed rate and adjustable
                    loans, as well as Jumbo products.

              <p class="text-muted mb-3">
                To qualify for an FHA loan, you must be a legal U.S. resident
                with a Social Security number and intend to live in the home you
                are purchasing. The target property will need to appraise for at
                least the proposed purchase price to qualify.

                    As a borrower, you will need a credit score of 580 to obtain
                    a loan with the 3.5% down payment. If your score is lower,
                    you may be able to get an FHA loan, but with a larger down
                    payment. Individual lenders may have higher credit score
                    requirements.

                How Does Mortgage Insurance Work
              </h3>
              <p class="text-muted">
                You’ll have to pay primary mortgage insurance (PMI) if your down
                payment is less than 20%.
              </p>
              <ul class="text-muted arrow-list">
                <li>
                  Mortgage insurance is required on almost every new loan with a
                  down payment of less than twenty percent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mortgage insurance protects the lender from losses, and this
                  allows them to offer loans they might not otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most conventional loans qualify for private mortgage
                  insurance, paid monthly along with the principal and interest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In some cases with a conventional loan, you can request to
                  have the mortgage insurance dropped when your equity in the
                  loan reaches twenty percent, but in other cases you may need
                  to refinance the loan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FHA loans have mortgage insurance that you pay to the Federal
                  Housing Administration. For these loans there is a fee at the
                  loan closing plus a monthly charge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FHA loans must maintain the mortgage insurance, so to stop
                  paying the MI, you need to refinance into a conventional loan
                  type.
                </li>
                <li>
                  VA (Veteran’s Administration) loans don’t need mortgage
                  insurance, because the VA guarantees the loan for you. But
                  there is an upfront funding fee that varies depending on
                  several factors, including:
